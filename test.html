<p style="color: #1c1f25"> Many travelers take renting a car for granted especially during the pandemic when isolation is a priority. Customers prefer convenient and timely service, but it's not uncommon for car rentals to lag. Roughly speaking, vehicle pick-ups delay every third time. Considering the tight competition in this business landscape, car rental services can’t fail to satisfy their customers.

In this article, we’ll tell you about the underlying modules of a Car RRS, review some of the key software providers, and give tips for those ready to roll up their sleeves and build their own platform. </p>
